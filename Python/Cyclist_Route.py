Description:

The following program consists of a simulation, in which a path followed by a cyclist is, in this case, generated randomly.

From the path you can get:
    - The max height and the number of times crossed with the maxHeight() func
    - The heights above the given threshold by using filterHeights()
    - Peaks and the number of times crossed by using getPeaksFromRoute()

Constraints:
    1.- The first element cannot be a candidate for a peak, as it is the starting point
    2.- To be considered as a peak, the element of the list is greater than the previous element
    AND is greater than or equal to the element that follows
    3.- If the last element of the list is greater than the previous one, it is the last peak
